# Progress Log

This log records remote-first maintenance and implementation progress for Research Assistant Agent. It intentionally excludes passwords, API keys, real `.env` values, cookies, private keys, and other secret material.

## 2026-06-12 Remote Handoff Baseline

Remote source of truth:

- Path: `/home/zhangwz/Research-Assistant-Agent`
- Branch: `main`
- GitHub: `ImpZhang/Research-Assistant-Agent.git`
- Current pushed baseline after formatting: `9178e46 Format research service modules`

Remote worktree notes:

- Two historical root-level docs remain untracked and intentionally untouched:
  - `research_assistant_requirements.md`
  - `research_assistant_technical_design.md`
- `uv.lock` was restored after `uv run` changed registry URLs during verification.
- Future verification should prefer `.venv/bin/ruff` and `.venv/bin/pytest` when dependency sync is not intended.

Verification summary:

- `.venv/bin/ruff check .`: passed
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .`: passed after formatting six service modules
- `uv run pytest -q`: passed before formatting, `43 passed in 727.94s`
- `uv run python scripts/smoke_api.py`: passed before formatting, manifest count `114`, project bundle file count `158`

Completed maintenance:

- Formatted six research service modules.
- Committed and pushed `9178e46 Format research service modules`.

Next planned work:

1. Implement durable project bundle release review outcome signoff evidence records.
2. Add schema, routes, graph links, tool manifest entries, project bundle metadata/artifacts, Workbench controls, tests, smoke coverage, README, and docs.
3. Verify with ruff, pytest, and smoke.
4. Commit and push the completed feature.

## 2026-06-12 - Workbench First-Run State Helpers

Implemented in progress:

## 2026-06-12 - Pilot Deployment Checklist

Documentation maintenance completed:

- Added a customer-pilot deployment checklist covering remote git state, `.env` handling, API-key protection, persistent storage, backups, health checks, Workbench verification, MCP bridge checks, and operator approval for state-changing commands.
- Linked the checklist from README deployment notes.
- Updated handoff TODO so the next P3 slices focus on write-operation audit design and later Workbench delivery empty states.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- Documentation-only change; no service start, dependency install, or business-code test was required.


## 2026-06-12 - Write Operation Audit Design

Documentation maintenance completed:

- Added `docs/write_operation_audit_design.md` to define purpose, non-goals, event shape, capture points, JSONL-first storage, redaction rules, acceptance criteria, and open questions.
- Linked the audit design from README, requirements, technical design, and handoff TODO.
- Kept this as design-only work; no middleware, persistence, route, deployment, or service behavior changed.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- Reviewed `docs/write_operation_audit_design.md` for secret-safe redaction guidance and design-only scope.
- Documentation-only change; no service start, dependency install, or business-code test was required.

## 2026-06-12 - Workbench Delivery Empty States

Implemented in progress:

- Reused `renderWorkbenchEmpty` for workflow preconditions that require an upstream idea, proposal, task board, experiment run, evidence ledger, release note, feedback record, acceptance snapshot, review outcome, signoff evidence, bundle readiness snapshot, triage snapshot, or research plan.
- Preserved loading/creating/recording progress states on `renderResult(..., "warn")` so empty states remain distinct from in-flight work.
- Added static Workbench assertions for delivery empty-state copy.
- Updated README, requirements, technical design, and handoff TODO.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- Confirmed no old-style precondition `renderResult(..., "warn")` calls remain for `first`/`before`/`at least` workflow empty states.
- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff check tests/test_app.py` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check tests/test_app.py` passed.

## 2026-06-12 - Data Backup And Restore Notes

Documentation maintenance completed:

- Added `/app/data` backup/restore operator notes to `docs/deployment.md` for the compose service and Docker volume.
- Documented what the backup must include, what secrets must stay outside git/public bundles, and why cold backup is the preferred first-pilot path.
- Added restore guardrails: do not restore over a live service volume, back up current data first, and verify health/readiness/Workbench after restore.
- Linked the backup/restore notes from README and updated handoff TODO.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- Reviewed backup/restore examples to avoid destructive restore-over-live-volume guidance.
- Documentation-only change; no service start, Docker command, dependency install, or business-code test was required.


## 2026-06-12 - JSONL Write Operation Audit Prototype

Implemented in progress:

- Added a disabled-by-default write-operation audit middleware for non-GET `/research/*` requests.
- Added `backend/research/services/write_audit_service.py` for JSONL append, operation/entity categorization, and metadata sanitization.
- Added non-secret config placeholders in `.env.example` and deployment docs.
- Added tests proving JSONL records are written when enabled, default-disabled behavior is preserved, and API keys/request bodies are not serialized.
- Updated README, technical design, audit design, status capability, and handoff TODO.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
