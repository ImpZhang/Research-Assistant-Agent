# Progress Log

This log records remote-first maintenance and implementation progress for Research Assistant Agent. It intentionally excludes passwords, API keys, real `.env` values, cookies, private keys, and other secret material.

## 2026-06-12 Remote Handoff Baseline

Remote source of truth:

- Path: `/home/zhangwz/Research-Assistant-Agent`
- Branch: `main`
- GitHub: `ImpZhang/Research-Assistant-Agent.git`
- Current pushed baseline after formatting: `9178e46 Format research service modules`

Remote worktree notes:

- Two historical root-level docs remain untracked and intentionally untouched:
  - `research_assistant_requirements.md`
  - `research_assistant_technical_design.md`
- `uv.lock` was restored after `uv run` changed registry URLs during verification.
- Future verification should prefer `.venv/bin/ruff` and `.venv/bin/pytest` when dependency sync is not intended.

Verification summary:

- `.venv/bin/ruff check .`: passed
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .`: passed after formatting six service modules
- `uv run pytest -q`: passed before formatting, `43 passed in 727.94s`
- `uv run python scripts/smoke_api.py`: passed before formatting, manifest count `114`, project bundle file count `158`

Completed maintenance:

- Formatted six research service modules.
- Committed and pushed `9178e46 Format research service modules`.

Next planned work:

1. Implement durable project bundle release review outcome signoff evidence records.
2. Add schema, routes, graph links, tool manifest entries, project bundle metadata/artifacts, Workbench controls, tests, smoke coverage, README, and docs.
3. Verify with ruff, pytest, and smoke.
4. Commit and push the completed feature.
