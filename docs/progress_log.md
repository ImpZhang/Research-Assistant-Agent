# Progress Log

This log records remote-first maintenance and implementation progress for Research Assistant Agent. It intentionally excludes passwords, API keys, real `.env` values, cookies, private keys, and other secret material.

## 2026-06-12 Remote Handoff Baseline

Remote source of truth:

- Path: `/home/zhangwz/Research-Assistant-Agent`
- Branch: `main`
- GitHub: `ImpZhang/Research-Assistant-Agent.git`
- Current pushed baseline after formatting: `9178e46 Format research service modules`

Remote worktree notes:

- Two historical root-level docs remain untracked and intentionally untouched:
  - `research_assistant_requirements.md`
  - `research_assistant_technical_design.md`
- `uv.lock` was restored after `uv run` changed registry URLs during verification.
- Future verification should prefer `.venv/bin/ruff` and `.venv/bin/pytest` when dependency sync is not intended.

Verification summary:

- `.venv/bin/ruff check .`: passed
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .`: passed after formatting six service modules
- `uv run pytest -q`: passed before formatting, `43 passed in 727.94s`
- `uv run python scripts/smoke_api.py`: passed before formatting, manifest count `114`, project bundle file count `158`

Completed maintenance:

- Formatted six research service modules.
- Committed and pushed `9178e46 Format research service modules`.

Next planned work:

1. Implement durable project bundle release review outcome signoff evidence records.
2. Add schema, routes, graph links, tool manifest entries, project bundle metadata/artifacts, Workbench controls, tests, smoke coverage, README, and docs.
3. Verify with ruff, pytest, and smoke.
4. Commit and push the completed feature.

## 2026-06-12 - Release Review Outcome Signoff Evidence

Implemented in progress:

- Added release review outcome signoff schema, API routes, tool manifest entries, graph linkage, project bundle metadata/Markdown artifacts, Workbench controls, pytest coverage, smoke coverage, README, and requirements/design documentation.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `.venv/bin/ruff check backend/research/routes.py backend/research/schemas.py backend/research/services/artifact_graph_service.py tests/test_app.py scripts/smoke_api.py` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check backend/research/routes.py backend/research/schemas.py backend/research/services/artifact_graph_service.py tests/test_app.py scripts/smoke_api.py` passed after formatting touched Python files.
- Focused pytest passed: `5 passed in 474.12s`.
- Full pytest passed: `43 passed in 752.08s`.
- Smoke API passed with `tool_manifest_count=118`, `tool_bridge_count=118`, `project_bundle_file_count=166`, and deferred release review outcome signoff evidence in the project bundle summary.

Committed and pushed:

- `d2e0741 Add release review outcome signoff evidence`.

## 2026-06-12 - Workbench Pilot Launch Status

Implemented in progress:

- Added a read-only Workbench Pilot Launch panel that aggregates onboarding readiness, onboarding progress, and project cockpit state.
- Added static tests and documentation for the customer-pilot first screen.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff check tests/test_app.py` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check tests/test_app.py` passed.
- `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_app.py::test_workbench_static_assets_are_served` passed: `1 passed in 3.55s`.

## 2026-06-12 - Handoff TODO Refresh

Documentation maintenance completed:

- Marked release review outcome signoff evidence as completed in `codex_handoff/03_TODO.md`.
- Recorded the first completed P3 slice and split remaining customer-pilot hardening into narrower follow-up tasks.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

## 2026-06-12 - Workbench First-Run State Helpers

Implemented in progress:

- Added Workbench helpers for API-key, network, and generic API errors.
- Routed repeated Workbench error rendering through the helper so first-run failures show actionable retry guidance.
- Added empty-state rendering for missing paper uploads and missing pilot report snapshots.
- Added static tests and documentation for the customer-pilot first-run state behavior.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff check tests/test_app.py` passed.
- `.venv/bin/ruff format --check tests/test_app.py` passed.
- `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_app.py::test_workbench_static_assets_are_served` passed: `1 passed in 3.56s`.

## 2026-06-12 - Pilot Deployment Checklist

Documentation maintenance completed:

- Added a customer-pilot deployment checklist covering remote git state, `.env` handling, API-key protection, persistent storage, backups, health checks, Workbench verification, MCP bridge checks, and operator approval for state-changing commands.
- Linked the checklist from README deployment notes.
- Updated handoff TODO so the next P3 slices focus on write-operation audit design and later Workbench delivery empty states.
- Preserved the two pre-existing untracked root documents and did not touch secrets or `.env` content.

Verification completed:

- `git --no-pager diff --check` passed.
- Documentation-only change; no service start, dependency install, or business-code test was required.
